Workshop Topics
===============

This workshop, 'R/Bioconductor Workshop for Genomic Data Analysis', is designed to introduce attendees to Bioconductor and a variety of its use cases; it is an intermediate-level lecture that presupposes some knowledge of R like that found in our 'Fundamentals of R' workshop.  The topics presented herein include the following:


* Intro to R and Bioconductor Basic Concepts
   * Brief review of R syntax
   * Introduction to the Bioconductor repository
   * Overview of motivations, data structures, and data management for genome-scale experiments

* Working with General Genomic Features Using Genomic Ranges
   * Introduction to Bioconductor 'ranges' package series
   * Range-oriented solutions for current experimental paradigms including RNA-seq and 450k methylation data
   * Parsing of BAM or BED formats and VCF file handling

* Genomic Annotation with Bioconductor
   * General overview of Bioconductor annotation
   * Introduction to Ontology concepts and tools

* Visualization of Genome-Scale Data
   * Overview of visualization tasks
   * Strategies for optimal visualization
   * Annotation-oriented visualizations





Purpose
=======

This site hosts the Jupyter notebook for the CBC Bioconductor Workshop 1.  The notebook will be served on the web as a static HTML page, meaning that while it looks like a live notebook, it cannot be edited.  To obtain an editable notebook file, please click the respective 'Download Notebook' link.  These four notebooks were created by Vince Carey.
